## Overview

The AI Assistant in the Smith & Williams Trucking TMS is designed to understand and execute natural language commands related to trucking operations, business management, and personal finance tracking. This framework documents how the AI is trained and how it continues to learn from interactions.

### Core Capabilities
- Natural language understanding for trucking industry terminology
- Context-aware command execution
- Self-learning from user interactions
- Pattern recognition for predictive assistance
- Multi-domain knowledge (business operations, personal management)

## Learning Mechanisms

### 1. Pattern Recognition

```python
class PatternLearning:
    def learn_from_interaction(self, user_input, action_taken, outcome):
        """Learn patterns from user interactions"""
        
        # Extract patterns
        patterns = {
            'time_of_day': self.extract_time_pattern(user_input),
            'command_structure': self.extract_command_pattern(user_input),
            'entity_references': self.extract_entities(user_input),
            'success_rate': 1.0 if outcome == 'success' else 0.0
        }
        
        # Update pattern database
        self.update_pattern_confidence(patterns)
        
        # Adjust future predictions
        self.refine_predictions(patterns)
    
    def predict_user_intent(self, context):
        """Predict what user might need based on patterns"""
        
        predictions = []
        current_time = context['time']
        current_day = context['day']
        
        # Time-based predictions
        if current_time.hour == 6:  # Morning
            predictions.append("Review today's scheduled loads")
        
        if current_day == 'Friday':  # End of week
            predictions.append("Generate weekly revenue report")
        
        if context['fuel_level'] < 25:  # Low fuel
            predictions.append("Find nearest fuel stop")
        
        return predictions
```

### 2. Feedback Integration

```python
class FeedbackLearning:
    def process_correction(self, original_intent, corrected_intent, context):
        """Learn from user corrections"""
        
        # Record the correction
        self.corrections_db.add({
            'original': original_intent,
            'corrected': corrected_intent,
            'context': context,
            'timestamp': datetime.now()
        })
        
        # Adjust confidence scores
        self.decrease_confidence(original_intent, context)
        self.increase_confidence(corrected_intent, context)
        
        # Retrain intent classifier if needed
        if self.correction_count(original_intent) > threshold:
            self.retrain_classifier(original_intent)
```

2. Entities extracted:
   - Origin: Los Angeles, CA
   - Destination: Phoenix, AZ
   - Rate: $3500
   - Pickup: tomorrow (computed date)
3. Action: Create shipment record
4. Response: Confirmation with load details
```

### Example 2: Financial Query
```
User: "How much did I make this week?"

AI Processing:
1. Intent: financial_query (confidence: 0.92)
2. Time period: current week
3. Metric: revenue
4. Query: SELECT SUM(rate) FROM shipments WHERE week = current
5. Response: Weekly revenue summary with comparison
```

### Example 3: Predictive Assistance
```
Context: Friday, 4:00 PM

AI Prediction:
"It's Friday afternoon. Would you like me to:
1. Generate weekly revenue report
2. Review next week's scheduled loads
3. Calculate driver settlements"
```
